Key Concepts
============

Newton Physics is built around a set of core abstractions that make it powerful, extensible, and easy to use for a wide range of simulation tasks. Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of the engine.

Core Abstractions
-----------------

- **ModelBuilder**: The entry point for constructing simulation models. You can build models programmatically or import them from standard formats (URDF, MJCF, USD).
- **Model**: Encapsulates the physical structure, parameters, and configuration of your simulation world, including bodies, joints, shapes, and physical properties.
- **State**: Represents the dynamic state of the simulation at a given time (positions, velocities, etc.). States are updated by solvers and can be inspected or visualized.
- **Control**: Encodes the control inputs (e.g., joint targets, forces) applied to the model at each simulation step.
- **Solver**: Advances the simulation by integrating the equations of motion, handling contacts, constraints, and physics integration. Newton supports multiple solver backends (XPBD, VBD, MuJoCo, Featherstone, etc.).
- **Importer**: Loads models from external formats and populates the ModelBuilder.
- **Renderer**: Visualizes the simulation in real-time (OpenGL) or offline (USD, Omniverse).

Simulation Loop
---------------

1. **Build or import a model** using ModelBuilder.
2. **Initialize the state** (positions, velocities, etc.).
3. **Apply controls** (joint targets, forces).
4. **Step the solver** to advance the simulation.
5. **Render or export** the results.
