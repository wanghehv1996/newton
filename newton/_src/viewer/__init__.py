Viewer interface for Newton physics simulations.

This module provides a high-level, renderer-agnostic interface for interactive
visualization of Newton models and simulation states.

Example usage:
    ```python
    import newton
    from newton.viewer import ViewerGL

    # Create viewer with OpenGL backend
    viewer = ViewerGL(model)

    # Render simulation
    while viewer.is_running():
        viewer.begin_frame(time)
        viewer.log_state(state)
        viewer.log_points(particle_positions)
        viewer.end_frame()

    viewer.close()
    ```
